# Online Encryption and Decryption Tool

# About the Project

This project is a web-based **Online Encryption and Decryption Tool** developed as part of the **Software Engineering** course. The tool provides secure encryption and decryption techniques to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

# Features

- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms:**
  - Caesar Cipher
  - Playfair Cipher
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with a simple and intuitive front-end.
- **Real-Time Encryption & Decryption:** Users can input text and instantly see the results.
- **Secure & Reliable:** Implements industry-standard cryptographic techniques.

# Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** JavaScript

# How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Online-Encryption-Tool.git
   ```
2. **Open ********`2.html`******** in a web browser.**
3. Click on **Star Encrypting & Decrypting**
4. Start encrypting and decrypting messages securely!

## How It Works

1. Select an encryption algorithm from the list.
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt.
3. Enter key
4. Click on **Encrypt** to generate the encrypted text.
5. Copy the encrypted message and share it securely.
6. To decrypt, enter the encrypted text and use the **Decrypt** button.
